# CRUD_MEAN_Task_Manager_SC
A CRUD MEAN web application with SSH security middleware. 
It was for my Security Aspects of Software Engineering course back in April of 2023 final.
##Introduction 
The idea and functionality of this project is aimed to create a seamless and smooth Task Manager/To-Do List(s) application. 

Each users lists and tasks are separate from one another, and gives the ability to cross off completed tasks, edit them as well as completely delete them from their list. 

Alongside that, each list itself can be deleted and edited (the name of the list specifically).

## Data Model
Users: 
•	Id: ObjectId (autogenerated by Mongo) 
•	email: string 
•	password: string 
•	sessions: an array that holds within itself
	token: string
	expiresAt: number
 
Lists: 
•	Id: ObjectId (autogenerated by Mongo) 
•	Title: string 
•	_userId: ObjectId 

Tasks: 
•	Id: ObjectId (autogenerated by Mongo) 
•	Title: string 
•	listId: ObjectId 
•	completedTask: Boolean

## Summary
In general, the apps performance is ok as the tasks aren’t demanding. Some features I could add would be the ability to resort/order by the lists/tasks by A-z and by the date they were made.

Another feature could be the ability to “star” a task and act like a pin of some kind that would protect it from being edited/deleted unless it was completed first.
